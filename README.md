Simple Email Filter & User Ban
========================================================================

This is a simple plugin for WordPress, tested on 4.1 but it should work 
on any installation that uses the settings API. If you test it on something 
other than 4.1, please let me know so I can make a list of supported versions.

You can find full details on what this plugin offers [here]

In essence, you get the following:

- Track User IP's on login
- Ban Users from logging in
- Deny registration to email addresses containing certain strings
